# BALANCE — M2 first full balance pass

Produced by `py tools/sim_economy.py` (mirrors `src/shared/Economy.luau` and reads the
real configs — regenerate any table below by rerunning the tool). The sim's greedy player
buys the cheapest affordable thing (slots and level-ups) every second; `--strategy rusher`
buys slots only. `--check` (used by QA) exits nonzero if any era of the default greedy run
misses its spec §4 band.

## Default run (greedy, legacy carried across advances)

| Era | Legacy in (mult) | Completed | Band | Longest wait | Wait ≤ 10 min | Legacy gained |
|-----|------------------|-----------|------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 Village | 0 (×1.00) | 41:50 | 30:00–45:00 OK | 14 s | 14 s | +78 (681 levels) |
| 2 Boomtown | 78 (×1.78) | 1:44:15 | 1:30–2:30 OK | 22 s | 5 s | +183 (815 levels) |
| 3 Metropolis | 261 (×3.61) | 4:28:49 | 4:00–6:00 OK | 58 s | 9 s | +268 (795 levels) |
| 4 OrbitalColony | 529 (×6.29) | 9:25:10 | 8:00–12:00 OK | 121 s | 14 s | +358 (795 levels) |

Total first playthrough: **16:20:04**, final legacy **887** (rebirth multiplier ×9.87 into the
second lap). No wait in any era's first ten minutes exceeds 14 s (pillar limit is 90 s).

Unlock beats (greedy): Era 1 — 7:16 / 18:18 / 29:30 / 41:25; Era 2 — 3:04 / 20:22 / 50:49 /
1:41:01; Era 3 — 4:54 / 50:04 / 2:20:50 / 4:22:54; Era 4 — 9:31 / 1:46:39 / 4:54:12 / 9:12:42.
Each era gets four pacing beats spread across its whole run.

## Rusher spread (slots only, legacy carried)

| Era | Rusher | Greedy | Spread |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 Village | 15:10 | 41:50 | 2.76× faster |
| 2 Boomtown | 1:07:57 | 1:44:15 | 1.53× faster |
| 3 Metropolis | 5:05:52 | 4:28:49 | 0.88× (slower) |
| 4 OrbitalColony | 14:40:35 | 9:25:10 | 0.64× (much slower) |

M1 carry-over item: Era 1 rusher spread was 10:44 vs 40:29 (3.79×); it is now 15:10 vs 41:50
(**2.76×**). Pushing further would need either early slot costs high enough to break the
30–90 s early-purchase pillar or level-ups so dominant that greedy leaves band, so 2.76× is
where I stopped. Note the rusher only "wins" in Era 1 — from Era 2 on, skipping level-ups
means skipping the milestone income that funds the steep slot tails, so rushing is neutral in
Era 3 and strictly worse in Era 4. The exploit is confined to the shortest era and costs the
rusher ~85% of the legacy a greedy run banks (122 vs 887 after a full lap).

## What was tuned and why

**Greedy's pace ceiling is the most expensive slot, not the monument.** Cheapest-first means
every level-up cheaper than a slot gets bought before it, so an era's length is governed by
its cost tail. All tail tuning below exploits this: the tail sets greedy's grind, while the
same numbers divided by base (unleveled) income set the rusher's grind.

**Game.json:** `levelIncomeBonus` 0.10 → 0.12 and `levelCost.factor` 0.25 → 0.22. Both make
the leveling layer (which only a player who levels enjoys) more rewarding. This is what let
Era 1's slot costs steepen against the rusher while greedy stayed in band. All other Game.json
values are spec defaults.

**Era 1 (ids frozen, values retuned):** slot costs from `windmill` onward roughly doubled
(windmill 100K … chapel 1.2M, manor 1.6M), tail compressed to stables 2.0M / watchtower 2.2M /
wall 2.4M, monument 3.6M → 2.6M. Net: greedy 40:29 → 41:50 (still in band), rusher 10:44 →
15:10.

**Eras 2–4:** `baseIncome` is exactly ×100 per era (spec §4 magnitudes). Base costs are ×100
at the head of each era but the tails are progressively steeper — Era 2 tops out at 2.6B
(≈ ×1000 of Era 1's tail), Era 3 at 1.25T, Era 4 at 460T. This is deliberate: carried legacy
multiplies income ×1.78 / ×3.61 / ×6.29 into eras 2–4, and a uniform ×100 curve would collapse
under it (the raw drafts simulated at 24 min for Era 3 and 26 min for Era 4). Tails were scaled
until the default run sat mid-band **with** the carried legacy — eras must never be tuned in
isolation (`--era N --legacy 0` will read slow by design).

## Deviations from spec defaults

- **Costs are not uniformly ×100 per era** (incomes are). Required to outpace the legacy
  feedback loop while keeping era heads affordable in the first minutes; spec §4 says
  "roughly", and this is the roughly.
- **Monument cheaper than spec's implied top step in Era 1** (2.6M, just above the town wall).
  Consequence of the tail-compression that keeps greedy in band; the monument is still the
  final and most expensive slot in every era.
- **`levelCost.minBase` (100) is global**, so each era's free starter slot has Era 1-priced
  level-ups: the first minutes of eras 2–4 are a cheap "max the starter" burst (a maxed starter
  is ~3% of era income, so it is a fun spike, not a balance hole). If the feel is wrong in
  playtest, the fix is a per-era or per-slot minBase — that is an `Economy.luau`/schema change
  and is *not* made here.
- **Cash packs:** flagged at M2, resolved at M4 - see "Cash packs and the era cap" below.

# BALANCE - M4 monetization pass

Nothing in the M2 tables above changed this milestone: no era, layout or `Game.json` value was
touched, and `py tools/sim_economy.py` produces byte-identical default output before and after
the M4 sim additions (diffed). All monetization constants live in
`src/shared/Config/Monetization.json`; the sim reads that file rather than restating any of it.

## Paid multiplier stack (spec section 6 rule 5)

| Source | Key | Multiplier | Applies to |
|--------|-----|-----------|------------|
| Game pass | `DoubleCash` | x2.0 | live, reported and persisted income |
| Game pass | `VIP` | x1.1 | live, reported and persisted income |
| Roblox Premium | - | x1.1 | live, reported and persisted income |
| Game pass | `OfflinePro` | x1 (income) | offline cap 8h -> 24h, efficiency 50% -> 100% |

`Economy.PassMult` x `Economy.PremiumMult` for a player who owns everything:

```
2.0 x 1.1 x 1.1 = 2.42
```

**2.42x, within the "<= ~2.4x" of rule 5** - the spec itself spells the stack as "2x pass x VIP
1.1 x Premium 1.1", so 2.42 is the intended number, not drift. `OfflinePro` deliberately carries
no income multiplier, which is what keeps the stack at 2.42 instead of compounding a third tier.
Nothing else in the game multiplies income for Robux; legacy and neighbours are earned.

## Paid vs. free pacing - convenience, never a gate

```
py tools/sim_economy.py                                     # free
py tools/sim_economy.py --passes doublecash,vip --premium   # fully paid
```

| Era | Free (default run) | Fully paid (x2.42) | Delta |
|-----|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 1 Village | 41:50 | 17:20 | -24:30 |
| 2 Boomtown | 1:44:15 | 43:09 | -1:01:06 |
| 3 Metropolis | 4:28:49 | 1:51:08 | -2:37:41 |
| 4 OrbitalColony | 9:25:10 | 3:53:36 | -5:31:34 |
| **Total** | **16:20:04** | **6:45:13** | **2.42x faster** |

The paid run finishes the whole game exactly 2.42x faster - income is linear in the multiplier
and an era's cost total is fixed, so the speed-up equals the stack and nothing else. A paying
player sees the same 24 slots, the same unlock beats and the same legacy (887 either way); they
just see them sooner. Legacy gain depends only on levels bought, so paying never buys prestige
power. The paid run reports `MISS` against the spec section 4 bands by design - the bands
describe the free player, and `--check` refuses to run with `--passes`/`--premium` so QA can
never accidentally band-check a paid run.

Longest early-game wait, fully paid: 5s / 4s / 6s / 8s (free: 14s / 5s / 9s / 14s) - well inside
the 90 s pillar either way.

## Cash packs and the era cap (replaces the M2 heads-up)

**Decision (lead ruling, INTERFACES.md M4 "Pack grant" + "Per-pack caps"):** packs stay priced
in minutes of the player's *current* income and are additionally capped as a fraction of the
current era's **total** slot cost. The cap fraction is **per pack**:

| Pack | `minutes` | `capFraction` | Largest possible single grant |
|------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `Cash30m` | 30 | 0.10 | a tenth of the era's slot cost |
| `Cash2h` | 120 | 0.25 | a quarter of the era's slot cost |
| `Cash8h` | 480 | 0.50 | half of the era's slot cost |

`packCapFractionOfEraSlotCost` (**0.25**) stays in the config as the family default for any pack
that omits `capFraction`; today all three declare one, so the default is only a fallback for
packs added later. Packs are visible in every era - the M2 alternative of hiding
`Cash2h`/`Cash8h` before Era 3 is **dropped**. Capping against era *total* (not *remaining*)
cost is what stops a late-era purchase degrading to Robux-for-nothing.

```
capFraction = def.capFraction or cfg.packCapFractionOfEraSlotCost   -- caller side
PackGrant   = clamp(minutes x 60 x incomePerSecond, 0, capFraction x EraSlotCostTotal)
```

`Economy.PackGrant` itself is unchanged; only its callers (the server at receipt time, the
client's shop preview) pick the fraction. The income used is the server's **persisted-rate**
flavour (no Studio debug multiplier, neighbours pinned to 1), computed at receipt time, so
neither a client nor a Studio playtest can inflate a grant.

**Why per-pack, and not one global 0.25** (this is the M4 finding that produced the ruling):
with a single 0.25 cap, all three packs delivered the *identical* amount past roughly the first
10-20% of every era - a player paying the `Cash8h` price received exactly what `Cash30m` buys.
Splitting the ceiling 0.10 / 0.25 / 0.50 restores a real 1 : 2.5 : 5 ordering for the whole
capped phase while keeping every pack honestly described by its "up to N minutes" copy.

`py tools/sim_economy.py --packs` - grants at the free greedy player's income at the halfway
point of each era:

| Era | Era length | Total slot cost | Mid-era income | Pack | Cap | Uncapped value | Delivered | % of era | Real minutes |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|----------------|------|-----|----------------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 1 Village | 41:50 | 14.97M | 64.49K/s | Cash30m | 1.50M | 116.08M | 1.50M | 10.0% | 0.4 |
| | | | | Cash2h | 3.74M | 464.33M | 3.74M | 25.0% | 1.0 |
| | | | | Cash8h | 7.49M | 1.86B | 7.49M | 50.0% | 1.9 |
| 2 Boomtown | 1:44:15 | 12.77B | 34.07M/s | Cash30m | 1.28B | 61.32B | 1.28B | 10.0% | 0.6 |
| | | | | Cash2h | 3.19B | 245.28B | 3.19B | 25.0% | 1.6 |
| | | | | Cash8h | 6.38B | 981.12B | 6.38B | 50.0% | 3.1 |
| 3 Metropolis | 4:28:49 | 6.40T | 6.12B/s | Cash30m | 639.96B | 11.01T | 639.96B | 10.0% | 1.7 |
| | | | | Cash2h | 1.60T | 44.04T | 1.60T | 25.0% | 4.4 |
| | | | | Cash8h | 3.20T | 176.15T | 3.20T | 50.0% | 8.7 |
| 4 OrbitalColony | 9:25:10 | 2345.61T | 1.07T/s | Cash30m | 234.56T | 1918.24T | 234.56T | 10.0% | 3.7 |
| | | | | Cash2h | 586.40T | 7672.95T | 586.40T | 25.0% | 9.2 |
| | | | | Cash8h | 1172.80T | 30691.81T | 1172.80T | 50.0% | 18.3 |

**The cap does the work, and spec section 6 rule 6 holds.** Uncapped, `Cash8h` bought mid-Era-1
would hand over 1.86B against a 14.97M era - **124x the entire era**, i.e. Era 1 and most of Era
2 in one tap. Capped, the largest single purchase possible anywhere in the game is **half** an
era's slot cost, so no pack skips an era at any income in any era, and the two smaller packs are
strictly further from doing so.

**Why "minutes of income" inflates so hard here:** income grows exponentially inside an era
while the era's cost total is fixed, so past the first few minutes a player earns an era's worth
of cash in a few minutes. At mid-era, the *whole* of Era 1 is about 4 minutes of income. That is
why a nominal 30-minute pack delivers well under a real minute of income at mid-Era-1 and about
3.7 real minutes at mid-Era-4 - hence the mandatory honest copy: every pack is labelled **"up to
N minutes"**, states its own share of the era, and every pack row shows the predicted
`Economy.PackGrant` beside it.

Where each pack starts hitting its own cap in the free default run:

| Era | `Cash30m` (0.10) capped from | `Cash2h` (0.25) | `Cash8h` (0.50) |
|-----|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 Village | 5:48 (14% in) | 4:56 (12%) | 4:14 (10%) |
| 2 Boomtown | 4:28 (4%) | 3:09 (3%) | 1:49 (2%) |
| 3 Metropolis | 12:47 (5%) | 9:50 (4%) | 4:54 (2%) |
| 4 OrbitalColony | 49:48 (9%) | 38:23 (7%) | 20:00 (4%) |

(Both tables come from `py tools/sim_economy.py --packs`; the cap-onset table is the same
simulation read at every second instead of only at the halfway point.)

**Is the value ordering honest for the whole era? Yes - no two packs ever deliver the same
amount.** `delivered = min(minutes x 60 x ips, capFraction x eraTotal)`, and both arguments are
strictly increasing across the three packs (30 < 120 < 480 minutes, 0.10 < 0.25 < 0.50), so the
minimum of them is strictly increasing too - there is no income, and therefore no era phase, at
which two packs tie. Only the *ratio* changes with era phase:

| Phase | When | Delivered ratio `Cash30m : Cash2h : Cash8h` |
|-------|------|--------------------------------------------|
| Uncapped (early era) | first 2-14% of an era (table above) | 1 : 4 : 16 (the nominal minutes) |
| Capped (rest of the era) | the remaining 86-98% | 1 : 2.5 : 5 (the cap fractions) |

**Relative pricing recommendation** (Robux prices are not set yet): price the packs no steeper
than the ratio that holds for almost the whole era, i.e. `Cash2h` at most 2.5x and `Cash8h` at
most 5x the `Cash30m` price. Roughly **1 : 2.2 : 4.2** is the honest choice - it keeps the usual
"bigger bundle is slightly better value" shape instead of inverting it, in every era phase. A
price ladder steeper than 1 : 2.5 : 5 (for example 1 : 4 : 16, matching the nominal minutes)
would make the big packs worse value than the small one for 86-98% of every era, which the "up
to N minutes" copy alone would not excuse.

## Analytics taxonomy (what shows up on the dashboards)

`AnalyticsService` wraps Roblox's `AnalyticsService`; every call is inside `pcall` and degrades
to a no-op. Currency names are exactly `cash` and `legacy`; balances are integers. Income ticks
are **never** logged (1 Hz per player would swamp the quota), and one `RequestLevelUp` granting
`n` levels logs **one** event.

| Event | Flow | Currency | Transaction type | `itemSku` |
|-------|------|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Slot bought | Sink | cash | `Shop` | `slot:<eraName>:<slotId>` |
| Level-up (per action) | Sink | cash | `Shop` | `level:<eraName>:<slotId>` |
| Offline grant | Source | cash | `TimedReward` | `offline` |
| Product grant | Source | cash | `IAP` | `product:<productKey>` |
| Legacy on advance/rebirth | Source | legacy | `Gameplay` | `era:<eraIndex>` |

Progression: one `LogProgressionEvent` per era advance and per rebirth, category
`EraProgression`, level = the completed era index.

How to read them: sink SKUs show which slots and which levels absorb cash (compare with the cost
tails in the M2 section); `product:*` sources against the pack table above show whether real
purchases land where the cap predicts; `offline` volume against session count shows whether
`OfflinePro` earns its price. The four `EraProgression` levels should produce drop-off steps
matching the free pacing column, with paying players arriving at each step about 2.42x earlier.

## Monetization constants and why

| Constant | Value | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `multipliers.doubleCash` | 2.0 | Spec section 6 pass table. |
| `multipliers.vip` | 1.1 | Spec section 6 pass table (+10% income). |
| `multipliers.premium` | 1.1 | Spec section 6 Premium. Stack = 2.42, rule 5 satisfied. |
| `packCapFractionOfEraSlotCost` | 0.25 | Family default for any pack without its own `capFraction`; all three current packs declare one. |
| `capFraction` 0.10 / 0.25 / 0.50 | per pack | Anti-skip ceiling per pack. Uncapped, `Cash8h` is 124x Era 1; a single global 0.25 made all three packs deliver the identical amount past ~10-20% into an era. |
| `receiptHistoryLimit` | 200 | FIFO idempotency window - far beyond any plausible Roblox retry horizon, and small in the profile. |
| `minutes` 30 / 120 / 480 | spec section 6 | Nominal, pre-cap; the UI copy says "up to" and names the pack's era share. |
| every `id` | 0 | No pass or product exists yet; `0` hides the item everywhere (spec section 6 implementation notes). |
